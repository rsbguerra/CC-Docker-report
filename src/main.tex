\begin{abstract}
    Hardware virtualization provides a reliable and secure isolated environment at the cost of the host resources and performance. Therefore, containers have proven to be lightweight while maintaining the bare-metal performance. Docker has become industry standard as it provides an easy to use platform to create and manage container. This paper aims to explore Docker's architecture and the main security and isolation functionalities that allows it to deploy secure and reliable containers.

    %For a long period, ensuring that an application's performance is consistent across multiple, while managing different versions of, programing languages and libraries was almost impossible task. Thus, IT departments started to adopt the use of virtualization.have solved multiple issues regarding portability and compatibility of applications, but also introduced the concept of application isolation, which allowed multiple applications to be executed in parallel in the same machine without the risk of interference between them, by creating multiple  on the same system. However, virtualization has several drawbacks, the biggest one being the performance degradation due to the heavy nature of virtualizing 

    %O abstract tem de ser um resumo muito resumido de “este era o problema, haviam estas soluções, tinham falhas (não precisas dizer quais), e o Docker propõe-se a responder a isso com o uso de containers”. Depois dizes que no artigo são explorados X, Y e Z tópicos sobre o Docker e, por fim, se o Docker é uma solução viável ou não (mais nada)

In addition, the need for portability was not fully met with. Hypervisor software from different vendors creates an additional roadblock to deploying applications regardless of the underlying hardware. Therefore, the IT industry has been steadily adopting the use of containerization. Containers provide an lightweight and
