\begin{abstract}
    Hardware virtualization provides a reliable and secure isolated environment at the cost of host resources and performance. Therefore, containers have proven to be a lightweight alternative maintaining near bare-metal performance. Docker has become an industry standard as it provides an easy to use platform for the creation and management of containers. This paper aims to explore Docker's architecture and its main security and isolation functionalities that allows it to deploy secure and reliable containers. Henceforth, Docker is a robust solution for the deployment of multiple real-world applications while better taking advantage of available resources and Linux kernel native functionalities and security model.
